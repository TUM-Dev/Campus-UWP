## ðŸš¨ Public Service Announcement ðŸš¨

> Currently, we are at a transitioning point for our TUM Campus Apps. We have three platform-specific versions: [iOS](https://github.com/TUM-Dev/Campus-iOS), [Android](https://github.com/TUM-Dev/Campus-Android), and [UWP](https://github.com/TUM-Dev/Campus-UWP).  
 However, maintaining these distinct versions has proven challenging, with notable issues including feature disparity and the need for individual bug fixes for each platform. Furthermore, this model is dependent on having a dedicated maintainer for each app.
> 
> As such, we have decided to consolidate our resources and efforts towards the creation of a unified, cross-platform app using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). You can access the new codebase here: [github.com/TUM-Dev/Campus-Flutter](https://github.com/TUM-Dev/Campus-Flutter).
> 
> By uniting our efforts under one platform, we aim to enhance our efficiency and streamline the feature sets across all versions, thereby offering a more cohesive and reliable user experience.
> 
> We invite and value your contributions to the ongoing development of the Campus-Android.
However, please note that we are transitioning towards a new [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)-based codebase, expected to take over the platform-specific apps in 2024.
> We thank you for your understanding and look forward to your continued support during this exciting period of transition.
If you have any comments/feedback about this decison, you can reach us at app <at> tum.de or by adding a GitHub issue
